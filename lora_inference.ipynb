The Eiffel Tower is a stunning example of French engineering and is a popular tourist destination. It was constructed for the 1889 World's Fair and was originally intended to be a temporary structure, but it has remained an iconic landmark for over a century. Visitors can reach the Eiffel Tower via stairs or elevators, offering stunning views of the city from its multiple observation decks.<|eot_id|>\n"
